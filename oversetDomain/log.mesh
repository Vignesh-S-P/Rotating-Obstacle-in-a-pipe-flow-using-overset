Starting reading patches at line 53034.
For group 1 named valve trying to read 200 patch face indices.
For group 2 named sides trying to read 420 patch face indices.
For group 3 named frontAndBack2 trying to read 9000 patch face indices.
For group 4 named oversetDomain trying to read 4500 patch face indices.

Of 9840 so-called boundary faces 220 belong to two cells and are therefore internal
Sorting boundary faces according to group (patch)
0: valve is patch
1: sides is patch
2: frontAndBack2 is patch
3: oversetDomain is cellZone

Constructing mesh with non-default patches of size:
    valve	200
    sides	420
    frontAndBack2	9000

Adding cell and face zones
 Cell Zone oversetDomain 	4500
